some standalone services like OpenSSH, and --unless otherwise configured--
services running under Red Hat's xinetd super-server, you can configure
restrictions based on network address in /etc/hosts.allow. The services
using inetd or xinetd typically include telnet, ftp, pop, imap, finger,

SHORT_EXP: "Telnet is not secure.

Telnet is shipped on most operating systems for backward compatibility,
and it should not be used in an untrusted network.

Telnet is a clear-text protocol, meaning that any data transferred,
including passwords, can be monitored by anyone else on your network (even if you
use a switching router, as switches were designed for performance, not
security and can be made to broadcast).  Other networks can monitor this information too if the
telnet session crosses multiple LANs.

There are also other more active attacks.  For example, anyone who can
eavesdrop can usually take over your telnet session, using a tool like
Hunt or Ettercap.

The standard practice among security-conscious sites is to migrate as rapidly
as practical from telnet to Secure Shell (command: ssh).  We'd advise you to make this
move as soon as possible.  Secure shell implementations are available from
openssh.org and ssh.com.  Most Operating System vendors also distribute a
version of secure shell,
so check with your vendor first to see if there is a version that has been
tested with your OS.

NOTE: Deactivating the telnetd service will not affect your telnet client."
