LABEL: tmpdir
SHORT_EXP: "Many programs use the /tmp directory in ways that are dangerous
on multi-user systems. Many of those programs will use an alternate directory
if one is specified with the TMPDIR or TMP environment variables. We can
install scripts that will be run when users log in that safely create
suitable temporary directories and set the TMPDIR and TMP environment
variables. This depends on your system supporting /etc/profile.d scripts."
