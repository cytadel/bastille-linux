SHORT_EXP: "Patching, updating, and configuring software to address known security
vulnerabilities is one of the most important steps in securing a system.
Software Assistant(SWA) and Security Patch Check(SPC) are tools which will analyze the software installed on
this system.  They will report if any relevant security bulletins which have
been announced by Hewlett-Packard are not currently addressed on this system.
Bastille has detected that one of them is installed.  If you have SWA version C.01.01
or later, Bastille will run that or else fall back to SPC.  The output of running that tool
will be appended to a file and referenced by Bastille's generated TODO list
so you can perform the necessary steps to ensure your systems' bulletin compliance.
Note that SPC, if used, may use ftp or http, cleartext protocols, in some cases.

LONG_EXP: "Patching, updating, and configuring software to address known security
vulnerabilities is one of the most important steps in securing a system.
Software Assistant and Security Patch Check are tools which will analyze the software installed on this 
system.  If you have SWA version C.01.01 or later, Bastille will run that or else fall back to SPC
to create a security-compliance report.  The security compliance report lists several types of
problems.  It will: (1) report any patches which are installed on the system
but have had warnings (recalls) issued by HP, (2) report any security patches
that have been announced by Hewlett Packard that will fix installed software on
the system, but have not been applied, (3) report if any currently
installed patches are not in the proper, \"configured\" state, (4) report software
that needs to be removed or updated to comply with a bulletin, and (5) list any
manual actions necessary to bring the server to bulletin compliance.  SWA and SPC
can download an up-to-date catalog from HP with security and
patch-warning information.  They can also work through a proxy-type
firewall.  Also, bulletin compliance requires vigilance, since new
vulnerabilities are found and fixed on a regular basis.  It is recommended that
one of these tools be run frequently, such as in a cron job each night (A separate question
will cover this).  It is also recommended that you subscribe to the HP
Security Bulletin mailing list.
Note that SPC, if used, may use ftp or http, cleartext protocols, if a link can not be established 
via https.
The output of running this tool will be appended to Bastille's generated
TODO list so that you can apply the necessary patches.

SHORT_EXP: "Bastille can configure Software Assistant, or Security Patch Check, as appropriate,
to run on a daily basis using the cron scheduling daemon.  Keeping a system secure requires constant
vigilance.  Staying up-to-date on security bulletins issued by Hewlett Packard is
critical, and these tools are the easiest way to make sure
this system is compliant with the steps required in HP security bulletins.
In addition, a subscription to HP's security bulletin mailing list is valuable
to find the latest security fixes from HP.  Note: this question is
asked whether or not you have Software Assistant, or Security Patch Check installed so
that Bastille can pre-configure cron to run them  after you have
installed one.

Note we recommend use of SWA, as SPC may use uses ftp, a cleartext, unauthenticated protocol. 

You may also consider getting notified of all HP security bulletins by
going to http://www.itrc.hp.com and registering for them by clicking on
\"maintenance and support for HP products,\" then selecting \"support information
