If you choose this option, you'll be changing the permissions on
some common system administration utilities so that they're not readable or
executable by users other than root.  These utilities (which include linuxconf,
fsck, ifconfig, runlevel and portmap) are ones that most users should never
have a need to access.  This option will increase your system security, but
there's a chance it will inconvenience your users."

SHORT_EXP: "Bastille can scan your system for world-writeable directories,
including base OS, 3rd party applications, and user directories.  Bastille
will then create a script which you can edit to suit your needs and then
run to tighten these permissions.

Changing the permissions of directories in this way has the potential to
break compatibility with some applications and requires testing in
your environment.

Note: The changes made by this script are NOT supported by HP.  They have
a low likelihood of breaking things in a single purpose environment, but
are known to break some applications in very subtle ways in a general purpose
environment (For example, applications which rely on unique process id's in
/tmp when run by different users may break when the process id's are recycled,
or programs which are run by different users but create logs in a common
directory may fail.  Other examples are listed in the long explanation.)

As you run the script, it will create a \"revert-directory-perms.sh\"
script which will allow you to revert to a supported state (independent of
the rest of the HP-UX Bastille configurations, which are supported). 
Running 'bastille -r' will revert all Bastille changes, including
running the revert-directory-perms.sh script.

Note: The changes made by this script are NOT supported by HP.  They have
a low likelihood of breaking things in a single purpose environment, but
are known to break some applications in very subtle ways in a general purpose
environment.  Here are some examples of known issues:

 - /tmp and /var/tmp sticky bit: applications which rely on unique
process id's in /tmp when run by different users may break when the process
id's are recycled (cleaning tmp directories regularly may alleviate this
problem)

 - Log directories (most of which are named with the word \"log\" in them): 
Programs which are run by different users but create and/or write logs in
a common directory may fail to log actions.  This includes GUI error logs
in some versions of HP-UX diagnostic tools.

 - \"cat\" directories such as those in /usr/share/man are used by the
\"man\" command to write pre-processed man pages.  Eliminating the
world-writeable bit will cause a degradation in performance because
the man page will have to be reformatted every time it is accessed.

 - Some directories may have incorrect owners and/or groups.  Eliminating
world-writeable permissions on these directories have no effect if the
owner/group is set properly.  For example, one problem with HP Openview
running without world-writeable directories was corrected by the following:

/usr/bin/chown root:sys /var/opt/OV/analysis/ovrequestd/config

This change has not been fully tested, but was shown to work when tested
in a limited, single-purpose environment.

 - Change the directory /var/obam/translated may have an impact on non-root
users viewing help in obam (the GUI library used by swinstall, SAM,
older versions of ServiceControl Manager, and others)

 - Eliminating the world-writeable permissions on socket directories has been
shown to stop the X server from operating properly.  However, setting the
sticky bit instead (what this script will do by default) did not have the
same effects.

 - There are several other directories which have world-writeable permissions.
Some of these are shipped with HP-UX, others are shipped with 3rd party
products, and others may have been created by users without an appropriate
umask set.  Bastille will help you find those directories so that you can
make appropriate decisions for your environment.  The full impact of making
these changes has not been analyzed.

As you run the script, it will create a \"revert-directory-perms.sh\"
script which will allow you to revert to a supported state (independent of
the rest of the HP-UX Bastille configurations, which are supported). 
Because of the potential for very subtle breakage, you should also keep
a record of any changes which you make manually to your system so that
you can revert them to help debug any problems which you run into.
Running 'bastille -r' will revert all Bastille changes, including
running the revert-directory-perms.sh script, but it may not revert
changes you have made manually.

The fact that a directory is world-writeable does not imply that a
vulnerability exists, because it depends on how the data stored in that
directory is used.  Still, it is a security best-practice to only grant
world-write permissions on temporary directories, such as /tmp and /var/tmp,
and to set the \"sticky\" bit on those directories.  By default, the generated
script will set the \"sticky\" bit on all world-writeable directories.

If the \"sticky\" bit is set on a directory, only the file owner, directory
owner, and super-user are allowed to rename or delete (and thus replace)
the file, regardless of the group and world write permissions on the directory. 
The ownerships and permissions of the files and subdirectories in that
directory determine how those files and subdirectories can be modified,
respectively.  You can tell that the \"sticky\" bit is set if there is a
\"t\" in the last permissions column.  (e.g.: drwxrwxrwt).  Left unedited,
the created script will set the \"sticky\" bit on any world-writeable
directory.
