SHORT_EXP: "The name server, \"named\", usually runs with privileged
access.  This allows \"named\" to function correctly, but increases the
security risk if any vulnerabilities are found. 
We can decrease this risk by running \"named\" as a non-privileged user and
by putting its files in a restricted file system (called a chroot jail).

NOTE:  If a security vulnerability is found in one of the files that has been
placed inside of the \"chroot jail\" then that file must be manually patched
by copying the fixed file(s) into the jail.

HP-UX Note: The general structure of the jail will be created but several
entries will be added to Bastille's generated TODO list which require
MANUAL ACTION on your part.  (HP-UX does not ship with a name server
configured by default, so much of this depends on how your system's name
server is configured.)

For security reasons, it would be ideal to restrict every process which
is listening to untrusted data as much as possible.  This is especially true
of network daemons, such as bind.  If a vulnerability is found in the
daemon, then a chroot jail will contain any intrusions.   Only a root process
can break out of a chroot jail, so Bastille will ensure that \"named\" is
not running as root.  A successful attack on \"named\" in a chroot jail
running as a non-privileged user will allow the attacker to modify only
files owned or writeable by that non-privileged user and protect the
rest of the system.

QUESTION: "Would you like to chroot named and set it to run as a non-root user? [N]"
QUESTION_AUDIT: "Is named in a chroot jail and is it set to run as a non-root user?"

DEFAULT_ANSWER: N
YN_TOGGLE: 1
REG_EXP: "^Y$|^N$"
YES_EXP: "You've changed the name server, named, to run in a safer mode,
one in which it is restricted to operating within the directory /var/named
or /home/dns on Redhat and Mandrake systems and /var/jail/bind on HP-UX
systems.

This \"chroot jail\" stops an attacker from using named to do more extensive
damage to the system if s/he is able to compromise the named.  This
should be mostly transparent to you, except in two respects:

  1) All of your configuration edits for named must occur in the jaildir.

  2) If you use ndc to control named, you will need to use

           ndc -c /<jail-dir>/var/run/ndc

  3) Again, all of your configuration files must be moved to the jaildir.

SHORT_EXP: "Until you configure your name (DNS) server, we would like to
temporarily turn it off.  In almost all cases, you should only need your own
name server if you own your own domain and you want this _particular_
machine to answer DNS queries.

This is especially important as there have been dangerous remote-root
vulnerabilities in several recent versions of BIND.  The security
principle of Minimalism applies here: minimize the number of possible
attack points to be least vulnerable to attack.

Even if you plan on setting up a name server on this machine, you should
deactivate it for now until you get the configuration files setup.   You
can reactivate it then by typing, as root:     /sbin/chkconfig named on  "
