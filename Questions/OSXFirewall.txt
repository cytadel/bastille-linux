SHORT_EXP: "The OSX firewall is weaker than it should be.

Among other things, it doesn't block connections to UDP ports by default, like
those used by the printing daemon or network time sync client.  Even when you
use the UDP blocking in Tiger's Advanced tab, the firewall still has critical
issues.  For example, the firewall allows an attacker to communicate with
otherwise forbidden ports simply by setting the source port to 67 or 5353.

SHORT_EXP: "Apple's firewall allows any computer to access the Bonjour
ports, 5353 (multicast DNS) and 427 (svrloc).  This service makes configuring
printers easier, but it also shares substantial information about your
computer with any host that can reach these ports, including your 
patch level.  An attacker can use this information to better target
your computer.  This should almost certainly be deactivated when your
computer is not on your personal or office network.

SHORT_EXP: "Bastille's replacement firewall for OS X has a default-deny
policy.  You must name the ports you'd like left accessible by other 
computers.  These are generally servers you are running FROM your 
machine.  Most laptops and personal workstations offer no TCP 
services.

Here are some examples of services you might be offering:

TCP 139	- Windows filesharing
TCP 80  - HTTP Web server
TCP 443 - HTTPS Web server
TCP 22  - SSH Remote Login
TCP 3283 - Apple Remote Control/VNC
TCP 5900 - Apple Remote Control/VNC

Please separate the port list with spaces.

UDP 631 - CUPS Printer sharing
UDP 3283 - Apple Remote Control/VNC

NOTE: You will need to open access to UDP 137 to use other computers'
      Windows fileshares.
