LABEL: configure_ipfilter
SHORT_EXP: "Firewalls generally make up the first line of defense in any
network security architecture.  IPFilter is a free host-based firewall
which is available for HP-UX.  It looks like you have IPFilter installed,
but that does not necessarily mean that it has been configured (Bastille
cannot detect whether or not the rule-set is appropriate for your unique needs).

Bastille can create a very basic firewall configuration.

WARNING: Firewalls are designed to keep people out of your machine.
Therefore, this section has the ability to keep you out too.  Blocked
communication can include traffic from management applications like Service
Guard, System Insight Manager, OpenView, System Management Homepage, and others.
To use any applications whose communication that is not explicitly allowed in
one of the follow-up questions, please see that application's Firewall- or
Bastille-interaction documentation for which ports to accept via the
ipf.customrules file described below.  The HP-UX Networking Ports Reference
Guide is also helpful.  The most problematic communication is either
externally-initiated, UDP or RPC-based.  Please be very careful when
answering these questions and verify that you can still login to your
machine remotely (and have physical access just in case) before logging out.

WARNING: IPFilter is only able to block traffic which is processed by
the kernel.  Network cards exist which take the processing of this traffic
out of the kernel for performance reasons.  This is referred to as TOE, or
TCP offload engine.  If you are using such a card (can be used for iSCSI
and 10Gb Ethernet), configuring an IPFilter-based firewall will have no
effect for traffic processed by that card.  Also, local traffic is not processed.

WARNING: This will OVERWRITE any existing firewall rules.  If you already
have sufficiently secure firewall rules in place, then you should say \"No\"
to this question.  Answering \"Yes\" to this question will create and apply
firewall rules that will:

(a) Block incoming traffic with ip options set.  These options are used
frequently by attackers and infrequently for any other purpose.

(b) Apply a custom rule-set from /etc/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/ipf.customrules
This file as delivered with Bastille will allow all outgoing connections
and keep track of them so that traffic which corresponds to those connections
will be allowed back in.  This basic configuration will allow most local
applications to operate properly without allowing attackers in through
ports you don't use.  The delivered custom rule-set also contains rules to
not log netbios nameserver, netbios datagram, and RPC portmap network traffic,
all of which can fill up your logs rather quickly on a large network.  Later,
you can add custom rules which better fit the specific needs of your
environment.  If you modify the custom file, you should rerun the Bastille
back-end (bastille -b) to apply the new rule-set.

WARNING: Changing this file has the ability to either increase or decrease
the security of your system.  After applying this custom configuration,
be sure to double-check the active rule-set and your ipf.conf file to make
sure that the result is what you intended.

WARNING: If IPFilter is not yet enabled on your system, Bastille will enable
it.  This may bring down the network stack for about 10-15 seconds.  Though
it is likely that all connections will be restored at that point, all connections
will suspend, and some may be lost (including Bastille's UI).  If your Bastille
connection is lost, you can check the results by running \"bastille -l" to
see if Bastille correctly applied your config, or the action log for more detail.
Alternatively, you may consider saving the Bastille config file and then running
bastille -b on a console to ensure you see Bastille\'s full output real-time.

(c) Block anything else, including all incoming traffic which you are not
asked about explicitly.

If this is the first time you are using Bastille to configure your firewall,
you will be asked about several service specific options if the applicable software
appears to be installed.  If you have already configured a firewall using Bastille,
you will only be asked about protocols which are currently allowed by the Bastille
configuration.

QUESTION: "Do you want to BLOCK incoming HIDS agent connections with IPFilter?"
QUESTION_AUDIT: "Are incoming HIDS agent connections blocked via a Bastille-set-up firewall?"
SHORT_EXP: "HP-UX Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) enhances host-level
security with near real-time automatic monitoring of each
configured host for signs of potentially damaging intrusions.

HIDS consists of a management Graphical User Interface (GUI), called the
System Management GUI, that allows the administrator to configure, control,
and monitor the HIDS system, and a host-based agent which is an intrusion
detection sensor, that gathers system data, monitors system activity, and
issues intrusion alerts.  The communication between the GUI and agents is
encrypted.  The agent listens on port 2985 for incoming connections
initiated by the GUI.

Answer YES if you are NOT running the HP-UX Host Intrusion
Detection System (HIDS) agent on this host.  Also answer YES if you ARE
running the HP-UX Host HIDS agent on this host BUT are you are running the
HP-UX Host HIDS GUI LOCALLY on this host (i.e., you are NOT remotely
managing this agent by running the GUI on a remote host).  Answer NO if
you are running an HP-UX Host HIDS agent locally on this host AND you are
remotely managing this agent with a remote HP-UX Host HIDS System Management
GUI.

NOTE:   You need to install and configure HIDS separately from
Bastille.  See http://www.hp.com/security for more information.

NOTE:  What HIDS does not do:

1. HIDS is not a replacement for comprehensive security policies and
procedures. You must define and implement such security policies and
procedures and configure HIDS to enforce them. A lack of such policies,
procedures, and configuration can result in attacks that go undetected
and/or the reporting of many false alerts; that is, HIDS will work but
your system may still be vulnerable.

2. HIDS does not prevent the onset of attacks. If your system is
vulnerable to attacks, those vulnerabilities will remain even after HIDS
is installed.

3. HIDS will not find static security flaws on a system. For example, if
the password file contained an illegitimate account before HIDS was
installed, that illegitimate account remains a vulnerability even after
HIDS is installed and operational. Furthermore, HIDS cannot authenticate
users of a valid account. For example, if users share password information,
HIDS cannot ascertain the identity of an unauthorized user gaining
access to a system via a legitimate account login."
