LABEL: ftpgeneral
SHORT_EXP:"FTP is widely considered to be fairly dangerous, but even
security-conscious sites might still run it because of the perceived
difficulty in educating users about alternatives.  Available
alternatives include:

 - secure copy, which encrypts names, passwords and traffic
 - web-based file archives, a much safer way of offering files to the public

The lack of widespread, free, Windows-based secure copy clients only
exacerbates the problem.  FTP is dangerous for several reasons, including:

 1) All passwords travel in the clear across the connection, allowing any
    intermediate hosts (and usually every host on the source and destination's
    local area network) to \"sniff\" unencrypted passwords.

 2) Ftp daemons typically need to run with root privileges, and most of the
    common ones have been found to have a multitude of security vulnerabilities
    over the course of their existence.  For instance, the ftp daemon included
    with RedHat 6.0 has had two major updates to close security holes since
    RH6.0 was released.  Earlier in this session, we updated your wu-ftp to
    the most recent one that Redhat advertises

SHORT_EXP:  "Allowing users to access the FTP server from anywhere on the
Internet present a security problem, and you should disallow this access if
possible.  The problem is that many users feel they need FTP access.  You
can disable user use of the ftp daemon, leaving anonymous download still
possible.  We do not recommend this for most site admins, unless they have
management's approval and are prepared to educate their users."
LONG_EXP: "The least safe configuration for an ftp daemon is one which
allows anyone to connect (via \"anonymous\" mode) and upload files.  Most of
the attacks that let an intruder gain root access on your box require that
s/he is able to upload files.  If you don't have anonymous ftp with upload
capability, the intruder cannot use those attacks unless s/he can get a user
name and password.  For the sake of safety, this mode is shut off by default
in most wu-ftpd configurations.

The next least safe configuration is the one in which users with accounts
on the system are allowed to access the server from the entire Internet.
The dangers stem from 1) clear text passwords being sniffed on the Internet
and 2) common vulnerabilities in ftp daemons that are allowed if anyone has
upload privileges.

Unfortunately, disabling this configuration is difficult, as this is what
many sites feel a need to use their ftp server for.  With a well
educated user base (and secure copy clients for their platforms), this
functionality is unnecessary.  Unfortunately, educating your user base may
be impossible at your site, especially if there are a large number of users.
If this is a 3 account server, that kind of user education may be quite
possible."
