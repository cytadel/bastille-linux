LABEL: stack_execute
SHORT_EXP: "A common way to gain privileged access is to provide some type
of out-of-bounds input that is not checked by a program.  This input can be
used to overflow the stack in a way that leaves some cleverly written
instructions stored in a place that will be executed by the program.  The
HP-UX kernel has the ability to disallow execution of commands from the
stack.  This will contain many of these types of attacks, making them
ineffective.

On HP-UX versions prior to 11.22, changing the kernel parameter
\"executable_stack\" requires Bastille to recompile the kernel.
Ensure that the current running kernel is /stand/vmunix.  A backup of the old
kernel will be placed in the /stand directory.
If you answer yes to this question on HP-UX 11.11 or HP-UX 11.22, you must reboot your
system for this change to take effect.

independent of any application which may have a vulnerability of this type.
Note that this will also break some applications (Example: Java 1.2 programs
will fail if using JDK/JRE 1.2.2 versions older than 1.2.2.06) which
were designed to execute code off of the stack.  However, you can run
\"chatr +es <executable_file>\" to override this for individual
programs if they break.

you can discuss these on the Bastille Linux discussion list.  You can
subscribe at:

You can also provide feedback concerning the HP-UX version of Bastille
directly to the IT Resource Center at http://itrc.hp.com, using either
