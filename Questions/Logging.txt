SHORT_EXP: "We would like to configure additional logging for your system.
We will give you the option to log to a remote host, if your site already
has one.  We will add two additional logging files to the default setup and
will also log some status messages to the 7th and 8th virtual terminals
(the ones you'll see when you hit ALT-F7 and ALT-F8).  This additional
logging will not change the existing log files at all, so this is by no means
a \"risky\" move."

Also, if you check the 7th and 8th TTY's, by hitting ALT-F7 or ALT-F8,
you'll find that we are now logging to virtual TTY's as well.  If you
try this, remember that you can use ALT-F1 to get back to the first
virtual TTY."

SHORT_EXP: "What is the IP address of the machine you normally log to?
Remember, this should be a machine already configured to accept logging.
If you have no such machine, select <Back> and change your answer.

Note: we ask for an IP address because this is safer -- it avoids DNS cache
      poisoning attacks on logging.  You may use a hostname, but it should be
      added to your /etc/hosts file..."

SHORT_EXP: "Linux has the ability to log which commands are run when and by
whom.  This is extremely useful in trying to reconstruct what a potential
cracker actually ran.  The drawbacks are that the logs get large quickly (a
log rotate module is included to offset this), the parameters to commands
are not recorded, and, like all log files, the accounting log is removable if the
attacker has root.

As this is rather disk and CPU intensive, please choose NO unless you have
carefully considered this option."
