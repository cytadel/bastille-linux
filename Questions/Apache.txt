QUESTION_AUDIT: "Is the HP Web Services Apache Web Server deactivated?"
SHORT_EXP: "If you do not plan to use this system as a web server, then
it is recommended that you deactivate your Apache web server.  Programs
that require an Apache server installed but do not bind to port 80 will still
be able start their own instances of the web server.  If you do not plan to
use your Apache server immediately, then you should deactivate it until
you need it.  Minimalism is a critical part of good site security.
NOTE: This will not turn off copies of Apache or other web servers if
they are supplied with individual products, nor does it disable APACHE_SSL."

SHORT_EXP: "When the web server is on, you may want to have it listen on
only the local interface, or on the local interface and a particular network
interface (like an ethernet card that's only connected to a bank of local
computers, none of which are attached to the Internet).  This is a
particularly good option for web developers."
LONG_EXP: "If you bind the apache web server to the local interface, so that
it isn't accessible to other machines, it can still serve up pages to
browsers/web clients on this machine. This is ideal for many web
developers, who don't need a worldwide accessible web server, but would
like to edit a web site locally before uploading to another server.  To
access the server, you would simply use, as a URL in your browser:

        http://localhost/
and
        http://localhost/some_page.html

Even if you fully deactivated the web server in the previous step, this
option still makes sense: if you or someone else turns the server back on,
it doesn't represent as great a risk if it isn't set to allow
connections from the entire Internet."

  As with all web servers, it is generally required to send and receive

  In many environments, the people telling the server how to behave are
  not knowledgeable system administrators by trade.  Before you discount
  this fact, take account of the wide proliferation of configurations
  under which any user on the system can instruct the server to execute
  arbitrary code for anyone who comes to the site, via CGI scripts."

We will prevent the web server from following symbolic links.  Apache runs
as user \"nobody\", and so it can potentially change/read any world
writeable/readable file on the system.  If we don't deactivate this option,
a user could potentially allow a web site visitor to view files not in the
web page directories.  Deactivating \"follow symbolic links\" will help
prevent this.  Further, deactivation can lessen the probability that a future
vulnerability in Apache could be exploited to alter world writeable files
on the system."

SHORT_EXP: "As mentioned earlier, one of the few inherent weaknesses in Apache,
true of web servers in general, is that CGI scripts allow any user on the
system to allow anyone who can access the web site (which is usually the
entire Internet) to run programs on the web server's host.  This has inherent
problems, but may be required at your site.  We recommend disabling
CGI script execution for now, while you take the time to read more about the
dangers and install some kind of protection."
LONG_EXP: "One security precaution that you should look into is using a
wrapper program that only allows certain users to execute CGI
programs.  You may even have your site's security administrator audit each
script before allowing it onto the system.  CGI scripts are not inherently
dangerous, but they need to be very carefully controlled by people who
understand the dangers."

any web directories that don't have them.  These index files basically create
a link to every file in the directory, whether one was intended or not.  This
step isn't necessary, but may be helpful."
LONG_EXP: "This can be mildly problematic, for example, when a user places a
sensitive data file that's required by a CGI script in a web directory.  The
data file must be readable by user \"nobody\", which generally means it must
be world-readable.  Without the automatically generated index file, a
web site visitor couldn't ordinarily read the data file unless they could
guess its name.  Still, this example is weak, as it illustrates the
flawed, yet all-too-common, principle of \"security through obscurity.\"
No examples were obvious to the authors of this script that didn't rely on
breaking the most obvious rule of web site creation, \"don't put any sensitive
files in a web directory with world readable permissions!\" "

answer no to this question.

The apache server, httpd, is given access to several compilers and system
libraries so that it can process cgi's, login attempts, etc... One way to
lessen the risk presented by this special status is to lock the daemon
(httpd) into a \"chroot jail.\"  In this case, the daemon has access to
only a small segment of the file system, a directory created specifically for
the purpose of giving the daemon access to only the files it needs.

The adjective \"chroot'ed\" is derived from \"change root\", since
Bastille sets the daemon's root directory ( / ) to some child node in the
directory tree.  Note, for experts: a root process can break out of a
chroot jail, but this is still an effective deterrent, especially since
Bastille will limit the number of common root attack vectors within the jail.

NOTE:  If a security vulnerability is found in one of the files that has been
placed inside of the \"chroot jail\" then that file must be manually patched
by copying the fixed file(s) into the jail.

NOTE: This chroot script was written to provide for a fully functional web
server inside of a chroot'ed environment.  For additional security remove
unneeded libraries and compilers as they may not all be used by your
Apache server.
