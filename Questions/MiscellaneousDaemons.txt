SHORT_EXP: "To make the operating system more secure, we try to deactivate all
system daemons, especially those running at a high/unlimited level of
privilege.  Each active system daemon serves as a potential point of
break-in, which might allow an attacker illegitimate access to your
system.  An attacker can use these system daemons to gain access if they
are later found to have a bug or security vulnerability.

We practice an exposure-minimization principle here: minimize the number of privileged
system daemons and you can decrease your chances of being a victim should
one of the standard daemons be found later to have a vulnerability.  This
section will require careful attention, but if you have doubts, you should
be able to safely select the default value in most cases."

However this allows any user to perform an operation that is normally
restricted to root.  There is an inherent security benefit to removing

is used on an NFS client to handle read-ahead and
write-behind buffer caching, which improves nfs mounted file systems
performance.  Turning this service off will have performance impacts if this
machine is still used as a nfs client.  biod is obsolesced in HP-UX

nfsiod increases NFS performance on the client side, though it is not necessary.

SHORT_EXP: "Mac OS X's ships with the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd)
active by default.  Bastille can deactivate it for you.  

This is a difficult decision for most security-conscious sites.  On the
one hand, incident response and forensics very much require that the clocks
at a site be synchronized to small fractions of a second.  On the other hand,
ntpd is a network-accessible root-level program, which makes it an accessible
and inviting target to attackers.

We would recommend against deactivating ntpd unless you know what you're doing."

SHORT_EXP: "The system logging daemon (syslogd) can listen on a network port 
to support remote logging facilities.  Remote logging can be helpful for
security reasons because if an attacker gains access to a single machine,
he can probably modify or delete the logs on that machine.  Storing the
logs on another machine can help with forensics and incidence response,
even if the logs on the local machine have been tampered with.

None of this will prevent an attack, and it won't help if this machine is
attacked.  syslog uses an unauthenticated protocol, so you may not be able to
trust certain information in the logs anyway.  Finally, as another daemon which
listens on the network, it presents yet another possible attack vector."

each boot, checks for new hardware, helps configure it if present, and then

can allow unprivileged users (non-system administrators) to add and configure
hardware with full root privilege.  This generates some additional risk.
