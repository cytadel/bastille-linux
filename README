Bastille  is  a  system hardening / lockdown program which enhances the
security of a Unix host.  It configures daemons, system settings and 
firewalls to be more secure.  It can shut off unneeded services
like rcp and rlogin, and helps create "chroot jails" that help limit the
vulnerability of common Internet services like Web services and DNS.

This tool currently hardens Red Hat (Fedora Core, Enterprise and Legacy/Classic),
SuSE, Debian, Gentoo, Mandrake Linux, HP-UX, Mac OS X and Turbo Linux.

If run in the preferred interactive mode, it can teach you a good deal about 
security while personalizing your system security state.

Bastille can also assess and report on the state of a system, which may 
serve as an aid to security administrators, auditors and system
administrators who wish to investigate the state of their system's 
hardening without making changes to such.  This assessment functionality
has been tested on HP-UX, Red Hat Linux (Fedora, Legacy, Enterprise) and
SUSE systems.
