Red Hat's latest package of Samba 2.0.8 misbehaves if it
is started with a TMPDIR environment variable that does
not refer to a world-writable directory. The patch "smb.patch"
can be applied to /etc/rc.d/init.d/smb so that Samba starts
correctly, even if root has a TMPDIR variable set when
using the init script.

Thanks to Jonathan Marsden for catching this.
