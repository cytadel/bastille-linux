		             Bastille User's Guide
	


OVERVIEW:

Bastille is a system hardening/lockdown program which enhances the security of 
a Unix host. It configures daemons, system settings, and firewalls to be more 
secure. It turns off unneeded services such as pwgrd and printing services
and configures client software such as rcp and rlogin to be more secure. It 
helps create "chroot jails" that help limit the vulnerability of common 
Internet services like Web servers and DNS, and can report the security configuration
of the current system, allowing an administrator to decide what, if any, changes are necessary.

Bastille draws from many major reputable sources on Unix Security. The initial
development integrated a number of Open Source developers' expertise.  
Contributions included Jay Beale's O/S hardening experience for Solaris and
Linux, major points from The SANS Institute book "Securing Linux Step by Step",
Kurt Seifried's "Administrator's Security Guide,"
from the HP-UX Bastion Host White-paper, Armor, CIS and other sources.

USING BASTILLE:

The tool can be used in three ways,: 1) interactively, to create a security-
configuration file, or apply one, 2) non-interactively, either to apply 
the configuration file from a previous interactive session, or 3) to report
the configuration status of the system.  Run interactively, the Bastille 
user interface has been designed to explain security issues to a system 
administrator, then let them decide how to let the tool handle the issues.
This both secures the system and educates the administrator. Employed 
non-interactively, the configuration engine is used directly without the 
aid of an interactive user interface. This makes the tool useful
for either duplicating a security configuration onto multiple machines, or
auditing a large number of machines.  The reporting interface does not change
the system, but creates html, and text files indicating the current status
of the system configuration.  If bastille had locked down the system prior
to the report run, Bastille will create an additional file that indicates 
what, if any, configuration drift has occurred since then.

Bastille should be rerun whenever new software or patches are installed
to check and see if those patches or software changed the system state.
Also, on HP-UX, if swverify is run using either the -x fix=true option 
or -F option to run vendor-specific fix scripts, then Bastille should be rerun.

The following steps detail how to use Bastille to configure a system, or 
create a configuration file that can be re-used later on a different system.

Step 1: Change to root user since Bastille needs to change system 
        configuration and settings.

Step 2: If making system changes, decide whether to use Bastille 
	interactively or non-interactively.  First-time users must 
	run Bastille interactively to create a configuration profile, 
	unless your distribution shipped with pre-built configuration files, 
	ex: DMZ.config. That can be accesses with the "-f" option  Please allot 
	an hour to read and answer all of the questions. Users of the 
	Linux Firewall and PSAD modules should allot an additional half hour. 


        INTERACTIVE USE:                

        When run interactively, the user interface guides the user through 
        a series of questions. Each step contains a description of the 
        security decision involved in hardening a system. Each question 
        describes at a high-level, the cost/benefit of each decision. 

        NON-INTERACTIVE USE:

        Security hardening can be performed directly through the 
        configuration engine. This method is useful for duplicating a 
        security configuration onto multiple machines that have the same 
        operating system and applications installed.

        The configuration engine uses a pre-defined configuration file. 
        This option can either use the file created in the default location 
	by an interactive session, or with an alternative one, specified by the "-f"
	option. 

Step 3: Follow the appropriate process (Interactive or Non-interactive) listed
        below based on your decision in Step 2.

       INTERACTIVE PROCEDURE:

       1. Decide which interface to use: 
          Two interfaces are available, an X interface implemented via Perl/Tk, 
          and a text-based interface implemented with Perl/Curses. Both
          interfaces are available on Linux, but the Perl/Tk interface is the
          only one that can be used on HP-UX.
              A. X interface implemented via Perl/Tk 
  	            - requires an X server
	            - is easier to use and offers the user random access 
                      between question modules. 
                    - provides "completed indicators" to show the user's 
                      progress.
		    - X11 traffic can be tunneled over an encrypted channel if
		      you use the ssh -X option.  See ssh(1) form more detail.

              B. Text-based interface implemented with Perl/Curses 
	            - does not have all the functionality of the other 
                      interface, but is lighter weight.
                    - useful for hardening machines on which no X client is 
                      installed. 

        2. Start Bastille:
           Type 
              /usr/bin/bastille   (Linux)
                      or 
              /opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/bin/bastille  (HP-UX)
           to start the tool using the X interface implemented via Perl/Tk, 
           or, type 'bastille -c' to start the tool using the text interface 
           implemented via Perl/Curses. 

           Using either interface, only the categories of questions relevant 
           to the current configuration will be displayed. 
   
        3. Answer the questions:  
           The questions are categorized by function, and check marks are used
           as completed indicators to note whether a category has been 
           finished. This allows a user to track his/her progress through the
           program.

           Not all of the questions apply to both Linux and HP-UX, so you will 
           only be asked the ones that apply to your operating system that 
           relate to tools that are installed. When answering questions, you 
           can use the "Explain More/Explain Less" button for more or less 
           verbose explanations. Note: not all questions have both long and 
           short answers.

        4. Save your configuration and apply changes.
           At any time, you can use the menu bar to save or load a 
	   configuration file, however unless the file is saved via the
	   Save/Apply button, available after all the questions are complete,
	   and active at the end of the question list, your config file will
	   contain additional questions that may be irrelevant to the target
	   system.  This is because until all the questions are answered,
	   Bastille does not have enough information to fully prune the 
	   questions to the minimum relevant.  For this reason, when saving
	   a configuration file for later direct use with the back-end, it is 
	   clearer to use the Save/Apply save mechanism first.  Also, the 
           Save/Apply mechanism will always save that copy in the default location.


        NON-INTERACTIVE PROCEDURE:

        1. Run Bastille interactively to create a configuration file if one 
           does not already exist.  A default configuration file is not 
           provided for all distributions, so the first time Bastille is used, 
	   it must be run interactively in those cases.

        2. Copy the configuration file to each machine you want to replicate: 
           Copy the config file from its location on the first machine to the 
           same location on the other machines. Note: Since some of the 
           questions are operating system-specific, the same operating system 
           must be installed on the machines to be duplicated as the machine 
           where the configuration file was created. 
                  /etc/Bastille/config                 (Linux) 
	          /etc/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/config    (HP-UX) 

        3. Install Bastille on each of the machines to be replicated. Run
           'bastille -b' on each of the machines being replicated. This can 
           be done en-masse and the action and error logs can be collected 
           for later review. 


Step 4: Review the log files.
        To view the logs in real time, use 'tail -f <log_file>' 

        The action log contains the specific steps Bastille performed when 
        making changes to the system. It is only created if you apply the 
        changes to the system. 
             /var/log/Bastille/action-log                (Linux)
  	     /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/log/action-log   (HP-UX) 

        The error log contains any errors encountered by Bastille while making 
        changes to the system. It is only created if errors occur during 
        execution. 
   	     /var/log/Bastille/error-log               (Linux)
	     /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/log/error-log  (HP-UX) 

Step 5: Perform the items listed in the "to do" list.
        After performing the actions it can do automatically, the tool produces
        a "to do" list that describes remaining actions the user must perform 
        manually. This includes reboots if any of the changes require a reboot. 

        The actions in the "to do" list must be completed to ensure a secure
        configuration. Note: The "to do" list is only created when the changes
        are applied to the system.
             /var/log/Bastille/TODO               (Linux)
             /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/TODO.txt  (HP-UX) 

Step 6: (Optional step) Use the "revert" option (bastille -r) if you want to 
        revert the system files to the state they were in before Bastille was 
        run. 

        REVERT PROCESS:

        The "revert" feature of Bastille returns the system to the state 
        it was in before Bastille was run. Note that if any changes to 
        the system were made in the interim (either manually or by other
        programs), those changes should be reviewed again to make sure they 
        still work and have not broken the system or compromised its security. 
        Before using the revert feature, read the revert-actions script to 
        ensure the changes will not disrupt your system.  
         
        On HP-UX, after running the revert option, check the "to revert" file 
        for any manual actions that must be performed to complete the revert
        process. The file is located in 
            /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/TOREVERT.txt   (only available on HP-UX)

        Note:  Besides some firewall options, reverting the system is the only
        way Bastille will make a system less secure.



REMOVING THE SOFTWARE:

When Bastille is removed from a system, it does not revert the system to
the state it was in before Bastille was run. Instead, removal of the software
leaves behind the revert-actions script. This allows the administrator to 
revert the configuration files that Bastille has performed without having 
Bastille installed.  In many cases, Bastille changes are recorded at the file 
level, so the revert-actions script is only able to revert the files which have
been modified.  In other cases, Bastille makes more granular changes which can 
be reverted programmatically even if you have made your own intervening changes
in the same file.  For example, permissions can be reverted to their original 
form even if you have modified the file on which the permissions were changed.

1. Use swremove to remove Bastille from an HP-UX machine.

2. (Optional) To revert changes on a system where Bastille has been removed:
      A. cd /var/log/Bastille/revert/           (Linux)
        	or
         cd /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/revert/  (HP-UX)
      B. chmod 0500 revert-actions
      C. ./revert-actions
      D. mv revert-actions revert-actions.last

3. On HP-UX, check whether a "to revert" list has been created. If it
   exists, perform the actions in the list to complete the "revert" 
   process. 
      /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/TOREVERT.txt  (only available on HP-UX)

SECURITY-STATUS REPORTING

Starting in bastille 3.0, Bastille can report the status of a system without
making changes.  This functionality is available with either the --assess or 
--assessnobrowser options.  The former will also bring up the report in a 
local browser, the latter, will simply save the reports in the file locations 
below for later viewing.


GENERAL USE TIPS:

1. The changes Bastille makes have the potential to cause other software
   to stop working. Therefore, the recommended method for using Bastille
   is to make the changes in a non-production environment, then fully test
   all production applications after Bastille is applied before putting
   the systems into production.
   
2. On HP-UX machines, don't run Bastille during a Software Distributor 
   operation (especially swinstall and swremove) because it may cause 
   file-lock errors. 

3. On HP-UX machines, don't run Bastille any time a system is being heavily 
   used (especially things that modify system configuration). During this
   time, Bastille might not be able to get exclusive access to some of the 
   files it needs, so some changes might not be made. If this happens, run 
   'bastille -b' when the machine is quiet to re-apply the changes.

4. Unless you patch your system, it can be compromised even though you use this 
   program. Therefore, it is critical to install the latest patches on your 
   system to ensure that it is as secure as possible. 

   HP-UX uses the Security Patch Check tool to help with this process. 
   (Bastille will help with the installation of the tool.) 

   Red Hat Linux maintains lists of patches that are required for each version 
   of their Linux Distribution. The lists can be found in the errata section
   of their web site (http://www.redhat.com/apps/support/errata/). You should 
   download all of the security updates listed for your version. Note: Each 
   patch is signed with a private key to help ensure that these patches are the 
   original ones. You can check these signatures by downloading Red Hat's 
   public keys and verifying signatures on packages.

   Other Linux vendors also provide some patching support. Please check
   their web sites for details.

   Bastille can help keep your machine locked down.  Since some patches and 
   software can return settings to their default values, you should re-run 
   Bastille to re-apply the lockdown and keep your machine secure.


5. Bastille should be rerun whenever new software, OS revisions or patches are
   installed.  It should also be rerun any time customizations are made that  
   might loosen security. Also, on HP-UX, if swverify is run using either the 
   -x fix=true option or -F option to run vendor-specific fix scripts, 
   then Bastille should be rerun.


LOCATION OF KEY FILES:

The configuration file contains the answers to the most recently saved session. 
      /etc/Bastille/config                (Linux)
      /etc/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/config   (HP-UX) 

The error log contains any errors Bastille encountered while making changes to 
the system. 
     /var/log/Bastille/error-log               (Linux)
     /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/log/error-log  (HP-UX) 

The action log contains the specific steps that Bastille performed when making 
changes to the system.
     /var/log/Bastille/action-log               (Linux)
     /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/log/action-log  (HP-UX)

The "to do" list contains the manual actions that remain for the user to 
perform to ensure the machine is secure.
    /var/log/Bastille/TODO               (Linux)
    /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/TODO.txt  (HP-UX)
 
The revert-actions script is part of the "revert" feature. It returns the files
which Bastille changed to the state they were in before Bastille was run. 
    /var/log/Bastille/revert-actions                  (Linux)
    /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/revert/revert-actions  (HP-UX)

The "to revert" file contains the manual actions that must be performed by
the user to finish reverting the machine to the state it was  in before 
Bastille was run.
    /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/TOREVERT.txt  (available on HP-UX only)

These  are  the  assessment report locations.  They are formatted HTML, text,
and a Bastille "config-file" respectively.
    /var/log/Bastille/Assessment/assessment-report.html  (Linux)
    /var/log/Bastille/Assessment/assessment-report.txt  (Linux)

    /var/log/Bastille/Assessment/assessment-report-log.txt  (Linux)
    /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/log/Assessment/assessment-report.html  (HP-UX)

    /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/log/Assessment/assessment-report.txt  (HP-UX)
    /var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/log/Assessment/assessment-report-log.txt  (HP-UX)

This file contains information about any configuration drift the system had
experienced  since  the  last  Bastille run.  This file will only be created when
there has been an earlier Bastille-configuration applied to the system.
	/var/log/Bastille/Assessment/Assessment/Drift.txt  (Linux)
	/var/opt/sec_mgmt/bastille/log/Assessment/Drift.txt  (HP-UX)


TROUBLESHOOTING:

   1. Changes made by Bastille might cause other software to stop working. To 
      troubleshoot, run 'bastille -r' to revert the system to the state it
      was in before Bastille was run, then check to see whether the problem
      has been eliminated.
	 
   2. $DISPLAY not set, cannot use X 
      The user asked for the X interface, but the $DISPLAY environment variable 
      was not set. Set the environment variable to the desired display to 
      correct the problem.

   3. System is in original state...
      The user attempted to revert changes that Bastille made using the "-r" 
      option, but there were no changes to revert.
		
   4. Must run Bastille as root
      Bastille must be run as the root user since the changes it makes affect 
      system files, etc.

   5. Problems opening, copying, or reading files
      Error messages citing problems performing these operations are usually 
      related to NFS file systems that do not trust the root user on the local 
      machine. Please consult the "options" section in the fstab man page for 
      details.

   6. Errors related to individual configuration files 
      Errors complaining about individual configuration files indicate that a 
      system has been too heavily modified for Bastille to make effective 
      changes, or the files, locations, or permissions of the Bastille 
      installation directories have been changed. 

   7. On HP-UX, If HP Secure Shell locks you out of your system immediately 
      when passwords expire, you may need a PAM patch:
      PHCO_24839(HP-UX 11.11).

   8. Bastille configures a firewall.  It uses IP-chains on Linux and IPFilter
      on HP-UX.  The most common conflicts are with firewalls.  When a network 
      service is not working that Bastille did not turn off explicitly, you
      should make sure the firewall rules will pass the ports you need.
