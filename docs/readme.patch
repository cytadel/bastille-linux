Unless you download and patch your system, you can be compromised
even with the use of this program. We (the Authors of this program)
highly suggest that you spend the time to get and install all the
latest patches for your system to ensure that your system is as
secure as can be made possible.

It should be noted that the Authors of this program have seen systems
of all types hacked into and compromised within hours of
installation/activation. Red Hat is not at fault - All Operating
System distributions bear this same risk.

You can find the required patches on Redhat's "errata" page, on their web
site.  You'll need all the "security updates" listed on the errata pages for
Red Hat 6.0 and 6.1.  Our current program will download all the required
patches, but it does not check the authenticity and integrity of the patch.
The danger is this: if Red Hat's web site gets cracked, and one of their
patches is made into a "trojan horse," anyone who downloads this patch will
have a major problem.

To prevent this, Red Hat "signs" each RPM with a private key.  Since this
key should not be stored on the web server, and is usually password
protected, the cracker could not resign the trojaned RPM.  You can check
these signatures by downloading Red Hat's public keys and verifying
signatures on packages.

Our PatchDownload program doesn't yet check signatures.  You can, and should, 
do this yourself, using pgp/gpg to check signatures of any RPMs that you 
download.
