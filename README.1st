This is the source tarball-specific README.  This tarball should really be
used only by developers trying to hack or create a new build rpm/deb/pkg/foo.
Please use your distribution-specific method otherwise, as described at
www.bastille-unix.org.

The Install.pl script is there to move stuff to the right locations, as the
rpm build script already does.
