- No undo logs are getting written.

- The errors and actions taken are not presented while running
InteractiveBastille so the user does not know if actions have been
correctly taken (needs to check /var/log/Bastille)
Suggestion: make BackEnd write to pipe Action&ErrorLogs when run
with InteractiveBastille and let InteractiveBastille show progress to
user
HALF FIX: Added -v option to API so that errors are printed
on stdout using GLOBAL_VERBOSE

- No verbosity levels are set, logs sometimes are too verbose and
cannot be trimed down

- Some Questions.txt's texts might not display correctly depending
  on your Tk's window's width and height (for example the 
  "limitsconf" question does not show the indented list properly).

- (in Debian) sendmail and PSAD questions even if you do not have
  either installed. The IOLoader module seems to be unable to skip
  them and remove them from the list of Questions. The error given is:

>>Only displaying questions relevant to the current configuration.
>>Question sendmaildaemon couldn't be skipped -- couldn't figure out which question to skip to!
>>Question psad_config couldn't be skipped -- couldn't figure out which question to skip to!

- In log-only mode the TK interface will not be able to proceed to changes since
  it tries to save the configuration. The user running bastille needs to have write
  access to it even if he is running bastille through 'fakeroot' to avoid the 
  "you are root" check :). Probably in the near future log-only mode should *not*
  try to write the configuration file and just go ahead and simulate the changes
  that would be made to the system.

-  Amanda will not work when the file permissions restrictions or the PAM limits
  are enabled (check Debian Bug #155510 and Bug #118613 respectively) this is due
  to :
        a) amanda using /sbin/dump, /sbin/restore, and /usr/sbin/tcpd as a normal
           user (and FilePermissions.pm) limits it
        b) amanda using big files for backups

  If you are using amanda _please_ do not have Bastille configure both restrictions
  or you'll end up with issues on these side.
